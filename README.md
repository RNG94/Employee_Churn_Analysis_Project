# Employee_Churn_Analysis_Project
In this project I have HR data of a company. A study is requested from me to predict which employee will churn by using this data.

ðŸš€ Welcome to the "Employee Churn Analysis Project"! This is one of my other projects, where I focused on creating classification models for various business environments.

In this project, I delved into the concept of Employee Churn, which refers to the phenomenon of employees leaving an organization voluntarily or involuntarily. I also explored the key differences between Employee Churn and customer churn. To gain insights from the dataset, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis and visualized the employee churn data using powerful Python libraries, matplotlib, and seaborn.

For the model building and evaluation phase, I employed popular classification techniques in Python using the Scikit-Learn library. I successfully made predictions using Distance Based, Bagging, and Boosting algorithms.

Additionally, I leveraged the capabilities of Deep Learning by using Tensorflow-Keras for more complex and sophisticated models. This allowed me to explore and implement Artificial Neural Networks, contributing to enhanced predictions.
